Basically i used two api's in this app, one for hindi and another for english version.

Used recyclerview for showing news in scrollable form.
 
This app shows Title ,Description , News Publish Date  and Image related to the news.
 
when you will click on any news article, it will open here in this app itself and preview for that is given below.
